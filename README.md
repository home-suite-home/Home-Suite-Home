# Home-Suite-Home

# Product Vision
  Our product, Home Suite Home is for anyone that lives in a home or manages properties remotely. With our product, users can track a multitude of metrics inside and out of the home. As well as, have the piece of mind their investment is protected with real time alerts when anything out of the ordinary occurs. Great for when the user cannot be there in person. Home Suite Home supplies a wide range of sensing devices covering the environment and health of the home. The sensors and software are designed using off the shelf components and open source software to allow for easy access and infinite customizability. Our product differs from competitors such as Nest and SensorSuite by placing a focus on overall property health. It would focus more on providing analytics on the usage of utilities that are found inside the home, providing the potential to catch issues before they occur, saving the user from expensive repairs. This is the perfect tool for property or building managers, homeowners and even hobbyists to take control over their homeâ€™s data and bring it all together in one convenient, powerful place.
