# Sensors.py
## Description
Verify *Sensors.py* can properly access sensor data from a web server, convert units and display the results correctly.
## Test Tools and Dependencies 
For this test, we are begining with the following tools installed:
* Atom Text Editor (Or Similar Code Editing Tool)
* Linux Command Line 

We will also need the source code we are testing as well as our test script:
* [Sensors.py](/source/HTTP_Component/Sensors.py)
* [sensorSim_constant.py](/testing/Manual_Testing/sensorSim_constant.py)
We will also need *sensorSim_constant.py*. This tool will allow us to mimic the behavior of a physical sensor. Allowing our testing to be conducted in a controlled manner without the need for additional hardware.
## Test Cases
### Functional Case
**Test Status:** *PASS*
**Test Data:**
We will use *25.00* for our degrees Celsius and *50.00* percent for our relative humidity. These numbers are typical values for indoor room conditions.
